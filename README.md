# Livonian Keyboard Layout
This Livonian keyboard layout is an expansion of the widely used Latvian (apostrophe) keyboard layout. With this layout apostrophe and backtick become dead keys for entering diacritics. The layout is designed to be used with the standard US keyboard layout.


## Layout

### Key output without dead key

### Key output after apostrophe

    äüēŗţȳūīōǫ
    āšḑ-ģ-ȯķļ
    žöč--ņõ

### Key output after backtick
*Dash means that the key is not modified*

    ǟǖ-------ǭ
    ------ȱ--
